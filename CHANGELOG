0.6.5
* Bugfix to source strength polynomials as a function of LST
* Changed "-a" in scripting.py so that "-a 0,1,2" includes only baselines that
  involve these antennas without autos (i.e. 0_1,0_2,1_2), rather than all
  baselines that involve any of the antennas.
* Corrected all 3C source postions in src.py using NED.
* Ported to numpy>=1.1, matplotlib>=0.98, basemap>=0.99.  Involved:
    - use of numpy.histogram with new=True in xrfi.py
    - importing Basemap from mpl_toolkits.basemap in plot_map.py
* Split dependency installation into two scripts: install_required.sh
  which installs the minimum needed to be able to install aipy and run
  "import aipy", and install_recommended.sh which installs matplotlib/basemap
  and is needed for most of the scripts that come with AIPY.

0.6.4
* Attempting to support easy_install/setuptools functionality while maintaining
  the simple building that already works.
* Feature added to plot_map.py to give (ra,dec),flux of location on a map
  when right-clicked.
* Changed how plot_map.py plots to use imshow instead of contourf.
