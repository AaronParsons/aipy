AIPY (Astronomical Interferometry in PYthon)

This package collects together tools for radio astronomical interferometry.  In
addition to pure-python phasing, calibration, imaging, and
deconvolution code, this package includes interfaces to MIRIAD (a Fortran
interferometry package), HEALPix (a package for representing spherical data
sets), and routines from SciPy for fitting. 

BEFORE YOU INSTALL
    This is a *nix package.  With some trouble it can install on MacOS, and
    it pretty certainly doesn't install on Windows.  You need to have
    python >= 2.4.

    You'll need to have the following python packages:
        numpy >= 1.0.4
        pyephem >= 3.7.2.3
        pyfits >= 1.1
        *matplotlib >= 0.91
        *matplotlib-basemap >= 0.9
        (* installation can occur without these, but some scripts will choke)
    Luckily, much of this is now automated through setuptools dependencies,
    but you have to have network access to take advantage of it.

    OPTION 1:
        You install the dependencies yourself.
    OPTION 2:
        You have network connectivity and root access:
            $ install_dependencies.sh 
    OPTION 3:
        You have network connectivity but not root access.  Follow the
        instructions at:
            http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools
        and apply them to each line in install_dependencies.sh

TO INSTALL AS ROOT
    > sudo python setup.py install

TO INSTALL AS USER
    You'll first install to a directory of your choice:
    > python setup.py install --install-lib <module_dir> \
        --install-scripts <scripts_dir>
    This puts the python module in <module_dir>, and the command-line scripts
    in <scripts_dir>.  The next thing is to tell python where to look for
    the python module.  This is done by setting the PYTHONPATH variable to
    point to <module_dir>.  In bash, this looks like:
    > export PYTHONPATH=<module_dir>
    However, you'll have to type this every time you open a terminal.  To
    avoid this, add the export line to the .bashrc file in your home dir.

COMMAND-LINE SCRIPTS
    Unless you installed as user, these will be in /usr/bin.  For more info
    use the "-h" option with any of these commands:

    apply_bp.py:        Apply the bandpass variable to UV data and write a 
                        new file.  Also linearizes quantization gain.
    combine_freqs.py:   Average multiple channels together (reducing the total
                        number of channels).
    compress_uv.py:     Applies "tar -cjf" to UV files, compressing them.
    fit_dly_pos.py:     Fit antenna positions and delays by phasing on to
                        multiple sources.  Still under development.
    lst:                Prints out local sidereal time + julian date
    phs2src.py:         Phase a zenith data set to a source, writing the
                        result out to a new UV file.
    plot_uv.py:         A very flexible tool for plotting data from a UV file.
    rm_mdl.py:          Subtract a sky/system model from the measured data.
                        Outputs to a new UV file.
    xrfi.py:            Generate a new UV file with RFI flagged.  Currently
                        only works with the "-s" option.
    xtalk.py:           Generate a new UV file with crosstalk removed, and
                        with signals at "non-sky" delays filtered.

PACKAGE INFO FOR DEVELOPERS
    The subpackage "optimize" was copied in from scipy-0.6.0, and then all
    code that depended on non-pure-python modules was removed.  If these ever 
    need to be updated, download scipy source and copy scipy/scipy/optimize 
    into aipy, and then remove any code deemed unnecessary.  Unfortunately, 
    then you may need to crawl through the code and replace all "scipy" 
    references with "aipy".

    The miriad source code (aipy/miriad/mirsrc) was included from 
    MIRIAD-4.0.5.  To update, download miriad source and copy $MIR/src/subs/* 
    and $MIR/src/inc/* into aipy/miriad/mirsrc.  Not all files are used, but 
    include them all anyway.

    Healpix source code (aipy/healpix/cxx) was included from Healpix-2.01.
    To update, download healpix source and copy src/cxx into aipy/healpix.
